## Overview and Origin:


![moneygram_logo](Images/MoneyGram_Logo.png)

MoneyGram is a financial technology company offering money transfer services (domestically and globally) and bill payment services for individuals and businesses. The current CEO and Chairman is W. Alexander Holmes. It is the second largest money transfer company with Western Union being the current leader in the domain of payments/billing and open banking, by a very close margin.

MoneyGram Systems was founded in 1988 as a subsidiary of Integrated payment systems, which was later rebranded to MoneyGram Payment Systems in 1996 after it became its own publicly traded company. In 1997 MoneyGram International was established as a partnership between MoneyGram Payment Systems and Thomas Cook Group, with MoneyGram Payment Systems owning 51% share, while 49% ownership went to Thomas Cook Group.

MoneyGram has been funded 5 times and has raised a total of $874M with it's last round of funding being in July 2021 for an amount of $815M.


## Business Activities:


MoneyGram provides services that allow for money transfer and bill payments both in person and online, domestically in the US and across the world, to over 200 countries.

MoneyGram circumvents the hassle of tedious and slow money transfers by accomplishing the transfers in the matter of minutes. It provides low transfer rates, while providing faster transfer speeds (although this greatly depends on the destination of transfer).

One of the challenges with money transfer services is with estimating transfer fees, this is particularly in the case of international remittances. MoneyGram provides a tool to estimate the transfer fees on its website, providing transparency and clarity with fees.

The company offers its services via the two operational models 

- Global funds transfer – This model offers services through a plethora of options like – third-party agents, retail stores, post offices, banks. It also offers services via moneygram.com, mobile applications, digital partners.
- Financial Paper products – This model offers money order services via the MoneyGram agents and financial institutions that are enveloped under the MoneyGram brand.


MoneyGram in January 2022 announced a partnership with Digital Wallet Corporation as a part of their strategy to increase their processing revenue in the years to come. MoneyGram’s money transfer platform allows the users of Smile Mobile Remittance, a subsidiary of Digital Wallet, to achieve near real time money transfer services.

MoneyGram has also entered a partnership with CoinMe and Ripple to support cryptocurrency transfers


## Landscape:


MoneyGram and its competitors have gone through a digital transformation in the past few years, especially during the COVID pandemic. These companies have strived to ensure that they can provide their in-person and retail services, via their websites and mobile applications. 

Some of these competitors and peers of MoneyGram include – Western Union, Wise (formerly TransferWise), Paypal, Remitly etc. 

## Results:


MoneyGram has been leading the charge amongst its competitors by entering strategic partnerships with fintech and cryptocurrency startups to ensure they possess the capabilities to provide faster and cheaper transfer rates, not just limited to traditional currencies but also cryptocurrencies.


## Recommendations:

In the years to come MoneyGram should focus on strengthening their digital platforms - website and mobile applications to provide their financial services with greater efficiency and to increase their reach to consumers globally.

MoneyGram would have to invest in getting into deals with providers of Iaas and Saas like Microsoft (Azure), Amazon (AWS) or Google (GCP/Google Cloud Platform). This will allow them to cut costs on expensive server farms and software development teams. Additionally, these providers would also be capable of providing strong analytics, Machine learning and AI solutions, that would help MoneyGram reach out to their global consumer base better and provide them with money transfer services efficiently.
